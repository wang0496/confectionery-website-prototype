# Confectionery website prototype

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Create an interative wireframe/prototype for a confectionery website.
  The name of the company must be either:
  - **Beau’s Bonbons**
  - **Coco’s Chocolatiers**
- *It should have real text content*—**that you have to write yourself.**
- Greys can be used for everything if you’d like. If you choose to use colours make sure they’re nicely designed and consistent.
- Placeholder images are good—there’s a bunch of different sizes and shapes in the “images” folder.
- *The website should obviously be fully responsive: working on screensizes from `320px` all the way to `~2500px`.*
- There’s also a bunch of images that you can download and use in the site as extra—but the layout is the most important thing. If the images are there but the site isn’t responsive you’ll lose grades.
- **Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.**

## Teacher’s expectations

This website is to prove that you—by yourself—can do everything we covered in class. Look back over all the assignments from the term, determine what kernel of knowledge they were trying to teach you, and see if you can implement it in this website.

There should be a significant example of everything we’ve learned this term in this website. **Leave the impression that you’ve confident with what we’ve learned and can apply everything.**

## Markbot’s expectations

- `header`, `header nav`, `header h1`, `header li`, `header nav a`
- `main`, `h2`, `div`, `section`, `img`, `footer`
- A Google Font
- CSS boilerplate: `cssviewport`, `borderbox`, `textsize`
- Standard media query widths: `25em`, `38em`, `60em`, `90em`
- Standard text sizes & line heights: `100%/1.3`, `110%/1.4`, `120%/1.5`, `130%/1.5`
- `margin`, `padding`, `position: absolute`, `position: relative`, `float: left` or `float: right`, `display: block`, `display: inline-block`
- A `background-color` or `color` hover state for the navigation links

## Browser testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

## Example

See the example website mockups in the “example-website” folder for a better idea of what’s expected.

**If your website looks exactly like this you’ll receive a 0.**

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.

**When you submit, Markbot will give you `1` or `F`—that’s just so you know that it was handed in on Canvas.** You’ll still have to write a *Request for Grade* and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
